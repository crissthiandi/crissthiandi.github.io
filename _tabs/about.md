This is a personal blog where I write about my thoughts, experiences, and projects. I am a data scientist and I like to write about data, programming, and life. I am a fan of R, Python, Js, Vue and Linux. I am also a fan of the Jekyll framework, which is what I use to build this blog.

My entries are written in markdown and I use R to generate the markdown files with math and data results. I write in 2 languages, English and Spanish, so you will find posts in both languages.

Entries about my life are written in Spanish, and entries about data and programming are written in English. There are some entries that are written in both languages, so you can choose the language you prefer.

I hope you enjoy my blog and find it useful. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me.
